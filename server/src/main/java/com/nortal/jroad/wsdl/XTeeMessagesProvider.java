// TODO Lauri: maybe we can remove it or we want to remove Request suffix from input names as it seems to be needed by
// xroad doc?
// Probably can drop - The name of the output wrapper element could be (but doesn't have to be) the operation name
// appended with 'Response'.
// Mapping input messages preferred way is not supported at the moment eg. add/addResponse - messages/parts are
// generated by schema element name suffixes and message/operation names are bound to those values
@Deprecated
