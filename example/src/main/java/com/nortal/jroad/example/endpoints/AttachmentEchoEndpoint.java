 * Sample service endpoint, which supports binary attachments. Please refer to the PDF documentation on how to create
 * valid Schema (xsd) files. These attachments are sent as binary and are never converted to Base64. If you need Base64
 * conversion for legacy purposes, then you have to implement it yourself. This is not fully compliant with the X-tee
 * specification, but encoding large files to Base64 is a huge waste of resources. If you want to use Base64 encoding,
 * you can always send your attachments inline, since MTOM is disabled. It is however heavily detrimental to
 * performance.

     * provide an InputStream and a content type. A simple DataSource, which takes a byte array and content-type in
     * string form is included. Usually you would use something like FileDataSource, UrlDataSource or you can easily
     * implement your own. All a DataSource basically does in this context is give an InputStream and a content type for
     * that InputStream. An alternative way is to define a DataContentHandler and pass an object+content type when
     * creating a DataHandler. This way you will have to implement a DataContentHandler and DataContentHandlerFactory,
     * however.
